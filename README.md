# LinkedList Implementation in Java

## Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of a **singly linked list** in Java. It demonstrates the fundamental operations of a linked list, including initializing, printing the list, and retrieving the head, tail, and length of the list.

## Features
- **Initialization**: Create a new linked list with a single node.
- **Print List**: Display all the elements in the linked list.
- **Get Head**: Retrieve the value of the head node.
- **Get Tail**: Retrieve the value of the tail node.
- **Get Length**: Display the total number of nodes in the linked list.

## Code Structure
- `Node` Class: Represents a single node in the linked list with `value` and `next` attributes.
- `LinkedList` Class: Manages the linked list with methods for operations like printing and retrieving details.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linkedlist-java.git
